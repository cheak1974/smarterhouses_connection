**Instance creation for Homematic**

`Add a file like my_homematic_connection.py in /config/connections`

`Add a line in this file to create an instance of the Connection:`


```python
# ./config/connections/my_homematic_connection.py
import core.globals
import connection.homematic.homematic

core.globals.pool['conn']['homematic'] = connection.homematic.homematic.Homematic(name='homematic', friendly_name='Homematic', interval=5.0, ccu_address='192.168.10.21')

# you can add as much connections as you are needing
```

The key for the Dict `core.globals.pool['conn'][KEY]` has to be identical with the content of the name argument.
