______________
**What is is?**

With this connection one could simulate a sensor that is receiving (random) data. By doing this
one could test rules and other functions without having a real physical sensor available.

______________
**Instance creation for Random**

Add a file like `my_random_data.py` in `/config/connections`

Add a line in this file to create an instance of the Connection:


```python
# ./config/connections/my_homematic_connection.py
import core.globals
import connection.homematic.homematic

core.globals.pool['conn']['homematic'] = connection.homematic.homematic.Homematic(name='homematic', friendly_name='Homematic', interval=5.0, ccu_address='192.168.10.21')

# you can add as much connections as you are needing
```

The key for the Dict `core.globals.pool['conn'][KEY]` has to be identical with the content of the name argument.
